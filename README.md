# Landing Page Data Analysis with Streamlit

This project analyzes landing page data to provide valuable insights into performance metrics such as conversion rates, user behavior, and other key statistics. The analysis is presented interactively through a **Streamlit** dashboard, which allows users to explore the data through dynamic visualizations.

## Features :sparkles:

- **Performance Metrics**: Displays key metrics like visit count, conversion rate, bounce rate, and average time spent on the page.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Provides insights into user interactions, page views, and time spent per page.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore the data with interactive charts and tables powered by **Streamlit**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
- **Date Filtering**: Filter the data by specific time periods to view trends over time.

## Technologies Used :computer:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating interactive data apps.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for generating graphs and charts.
- **Google Analytics API** (optional): To collect data from the landing page (if integrated).
